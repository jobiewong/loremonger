# Loremonger

This template should help get you started developing with Tauri, React and Typescript in Vite.

## Recommended IDE Setup

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Tauri](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tauri-apps.tauri-vscode) + [rust-analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer)

## Todo

- [ ] Detect if fmmpeg is installed and give option to download it if not
- [ ] Docs: write README
- [ ] Refactor: audio-upload component
- [ ] Delete associated files when deleting a session or campaign
- [ ] Promopt when re-transcribing audio for a session that old data will be overwritten
- [ ] Implement Obsidian-style markdown linking for notes to create a networked knowledge base
- [ ] Add functionality to scan existing notes (locations, events, people) in a campaign's output directory and automatically update them based on new session transcripts
